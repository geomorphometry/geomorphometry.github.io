## Guidelines for comments

We try our best to make sure that the discussions on our articles aren't troll, spam and abuse-free but we’re not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

- We do not tolerate racism, sexism, and hate speech of any kind;

- We seek to encourage a wide diversity of opinions;

- Debate and discussion is expected;

- We respect each other and are careful to use polite and civil language (don’t troll);

- We avoid aggressive “in your face” language and trolling;

- We do not ban, mute, or delete comments unless they are spam, porn, or hate speech;

- No promotions and scams will be allowed.


If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – our moderators highly appreciate your support!

Happy commenting!
