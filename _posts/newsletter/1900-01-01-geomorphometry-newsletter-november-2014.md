This is to remind all our members that the submission deadline for the Geomorphometry.org/2015 is due in 5 days i.e. on **28th of November**. If you plan to participate in the Geomorphometry.org/2015 conference next year in Poznan, this is your last chance to submit an extended abstract and compete for one of the oral talks. Please note that there will be **no extensions of this deadline!** For more information please feel free to contact the organizing committee.  

Instructions: To submit a 2-4 pages summary papers for the Geomorphometry 2015 use the [EasyChair conference system](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=geomorph2015). **Do not submit your work by e-mail**. Do not submit MS word documents but only PDF versions of your paper. Detailed instructions on how to preprare you extended abstract and how to submit it are available here. Each submission will go through a peer-review process and will be rated by the members of the scientific committee. Revisions and final acceptance of the extended abstracts will be closed in February 2015. After that we will publish the working programme of the conference and open the full registrations. We look forward to seeing you in Poznan!!

**Important dates:**

- **Extended abstracts due: 28 November 2014**

WorldDEM, the new global elevation data set with resolution of 12 m and amazing vertical accuracy of <±2 m ([http://www.astrium-geo.com/worlddem/](http://www.astrium-geo.com/worlddem/)) is now available for pre-order. See availability of the finished tiles at http://worlddem-database.infoterra.de/

If you are looking for high resolution global **full coverage** DEM data (based on the SRTM DEM), [Christoph Hormann](http://www.imagico.de/) and Jonathan de Ferranti have prepared a public repository where you can download 3'' arcsec resolution data ([http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html)) at no cost. The authors claim that these tiles have been filled and corrected from the best available [alternative sources](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#altsrc). **See also external links to an [independent review](http://www.imagico.de/pov/earth_srtm.html), and some [photographic comparisons](http://www.earthshot.net/cg_world/terrain_front.html).**

[Geomorphometry community](https://plus.google.com/communities/113199568200837731421) is now also on G+. Join this community and post opinions, announcements and short stories and follow up the work of your colleagues...
