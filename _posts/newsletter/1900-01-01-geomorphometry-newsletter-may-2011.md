**World as a potato?** 
After just two years in orbit, [ESA's GOCE](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/GOCE/) satellite has gathered enough data to map Earth's gravity with unrivaled precision. Scientists now have access to the most accurate model of the 'geoid' ever produced to further our understanding of how Earth works. With a bit of exaggeration, one would get an idea that our globe is a large potato. The map of gravity undulations can be downloaded from [here](http://www.esa.int/esaMI/GOCE/SEMRCXSHKHF_1.html). See also the complete [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBzBikb5fso) about the project.
