**Geomorphometry 2011: Second Call for papers**  

The third Geomorphometry conference will be held in September 7-11, 2011 (Wednesday to Sunday) at the [ESRI Campus Redlands](http://www.esri.com/about-esri/redlands/index.html), California, USA. Prospective authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 4 pages (ca 2000 words) by **1st of March 2011**. Extended abstracts must be original works by the authors, not be currently under review in the same form by another outlet and not submitted elsewhere prior to the notification date.

**OpenTopography - publicly available elevation data**  
San Diego Supercomputer Center, University of California has recently launched a portal to share High-Resolution Topography Data and Tools. Visit [http://www.opentopography.org](http://www.opentopography.org/) to obtain the publicly available data sets and tools. At the moment the portal offers a large number of LiDAR surveys (mainly in USA) and will hopefully lead to complete-coverage publicly available elevation data sets.

**Geomorphometry** is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis (also known as the science of DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELLING AND ANALYSIS). The focus of geomorphometry is calculation of surface-form measures (land-surface parameters) and features (objects), which may be used to improve the mapping and modelling of landforms, soils, vegetation, land use, natural hazards, and other information.
