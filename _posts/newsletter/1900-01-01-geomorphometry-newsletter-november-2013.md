Our conference in Nanjing has closed 2 weeks ago. It was on the end a very smooth event with many excellent discussions and workshops (see the photo gallery). During the conference, the participants, and our international members, were asked to rate extended abstracts submitted to the programme. The current stand of papers is available via our society website. Please help us filter out the best papers by rating the papers in the programme via the geomorphometry.org website.

The submission for full-length research papers for the special issue of <a href="http://www.earth-surface-dynamics.net/general_information/special_issues.html">Earth Surface Dynamics</a> journal is now open! We are looking for about 12-18 original research papers on topics from the Geomorphometry.org/2013 conference, but we also welcome any other contribution by the wider scientific community.ESurf is an open-access interactive journal (interactive comments are published alongside the discussion paper and will remain permanently archived, publicly accessible and fully citable) with **<a href="http://www.earth-surface-dynamics.net/submission/service_charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no publication charges</a>**. It had ca 40 papers submitted in the past 6 months making it one of the most successful launches of the Copernicus journals
