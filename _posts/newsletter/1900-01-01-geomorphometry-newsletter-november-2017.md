Dear Geomorphometry members, we are happy to inform you that the long-awaited anticipated 1st call for the Geomorphometry.org/2018 is finally here! Please reserve these dates in your calendar: **August 13â€“17, 2018 | Boulder CO, USA**.  

Abstract submissions are now open. Please use [EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/cfp/Geomorphometry_2018) to submit 1-4 pages abstract. All abstracts need to be submitted following the **[manuscript preparation guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/02/10/manuscript-preparation-guidelines_2018)**. Also note our submission deadlines indicated below.Instructions: To submit a 2-4 pages summary papers for the Geomorphometry 2018 use the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/cfp/Geomorphometry_2018). **Do not submit your work by e-mail**. Do not submit MS word documents but only PDF versions of your paper. Detailed instructions on how to prepare you extended abstract and how to submit it are available [**here**]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/02/10/manuscript-preparation-guidelines_2018). Each submission will go through a peer-review process and will be rated by the members of the scientific committee. Revisions and final acceptance of the extended abstracts will be closed in May 2018. After that we will publish the working programme of the conference and open the full registrations.

**Important dates:**

- [EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/cfp/Geomorphometry_2018) opens for submissions: 1 December 2017
- Extended 4 page abstracts due to EasyChair: **1 February 2018**
- Workshop proposals due: 15 February 2018
- Notification of acceptance and required revisions: 1 March 2018
- Registration opens: 1 March 2018
- Schedule finalized: 1 April 2018
- Final camera-ready digital manuscripts due: 15 May 2018
- Early registration deadline: 15 July 2018
- Conference: August 13-17 2018

At Geomorphometry.org/2018 We are expecting a number of exciting keynotes, invited lectures and workshops:

- [**David Tarboton**](http://hydrology.usu.edu/dtarb/), Professor at Utah State University
- [**Dai Yamazaki**](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/), Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo | [MERIT DEM](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/): a high-accuracy global elevation map by multi-component error removal

Themes include but are not limited to:

- Use of Digital Elevation, Terrain and Surface Models and Canopy Heigh Models in hydrological modeling and biogeography
- Acquisition and processing of high resolution elevation data collected with LIDAR and photogrammetry (structure from motion)
- Mapping and analyzing Earth surface at ultra-high resolutions using sUAS (small Unmanned Aerial Systems)
- New algorithms and software for automated interpretation of digital elevation data
- Modeling extreme processes and natural hazards on the Earth surface
- Modeling and analyzing urban topography (3D cities) using lidar or photogrammetry data
- Multi-scale automated mapping of Earth surface changes
- Acquisition and analysis of bathymetry data
- Working with continental-scale high resolution data
- Simulating changes of the Earth surface relief
- 3D and 4D dynamics of Earth surface
