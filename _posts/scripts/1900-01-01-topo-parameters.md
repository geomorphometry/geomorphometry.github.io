hort title:  TOPO.AML

Inputs: INPUTDEM - a grid representing a continuous surface.  
Outputs: a set of geomorphometric parameters.  
&r topo INPUTDEM {streamflow threshold} {streamcover} (i.e. &r topo ls10 150)

Purpose and use: 

It's a compilation of grid commands to calculate some geomorphometric parameters in one go. To avoid mistyping, different approaches between different projects, time saving, etc.
