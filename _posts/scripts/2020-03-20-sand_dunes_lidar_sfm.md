This paper presents an evaluation of Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to obtain high-resolution elevation data of coastal sand dunes based on images acquired by Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA).  

The analyzes were made using [GRASS-GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) trough python scripts. Denoising of SfM-MVS DEMs were made with [WhiteBox](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/). Although the DEMs cannot be shared in GitHub (due to space limitations), the scripts can be used as an educational resource.  

The LiDAR and SfM-MVS datasets can be accessed at:
