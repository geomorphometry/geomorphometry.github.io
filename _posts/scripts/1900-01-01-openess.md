**Short title:**  openness.lsc

Inputs: A DEM (uses the Baranja Hill DEM25m.asc as an example).  
Outputs: A raster of 'openness' that describes how exposed a surface is at each location. The measure is an angle where values close to 0 are very sheltered and 180 is an exposed plane.

**Purpose and use:** 

Script to calculate 'openness' as defined by Yokoyama, Shirasawa and Pike (2002). It is designed to demonstrate how LandScript can be used to calculate new geomorphometric parameters using map algebra. To use this script, start LandSerf 2.3 or above and then open the LandScript editor (menu: Edit->LandSctipt Editor).

**Programming environment**:  Landserf
