In the paper, a first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use.  

The analyzes were made using [GRASS-GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) trough python scripts. Although the DEMs cannot be shared in GitHub (due to both space limitations and licensing of TanDEM-X), the scripts can be used as an educational resource.
