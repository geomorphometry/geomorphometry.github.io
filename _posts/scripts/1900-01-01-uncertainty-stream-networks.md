**Short title**:  streams\_error

A Sextante implementation of these algorithms called **FlowTools** can be obtained [here](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/~d_nues01/flowtools/) (contributed by [Daniel NÃ¼st](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/~d_nues01/)). The project report can be downloaded as a PDF. You can access the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) project "flowTools" in the following public Subversion repository:

http://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/FlowTools/

You can also download an initial version (might be outdated!) of the project folder as a [zip file]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/datasets/flowTools.zip) (12).

**Purpose and use**: 

Extraction of stream networks from a DEM using error propagation technique.

**Programming environment**:  R / S language  
**Status of work**:  Public Domain  
**Reference**:  [On the uncertainty of stream networks derived from elevation data: the error propagation approach](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-14-1153-2010)
