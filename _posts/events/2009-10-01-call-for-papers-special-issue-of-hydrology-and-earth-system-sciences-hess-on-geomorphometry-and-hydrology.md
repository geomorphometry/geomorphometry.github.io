We invite submissions to a special issue of Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (HESS) on Geomorphometry and Hydrology to coincide with the conference Geomorphometry 2009, held in Zurich in September 2009. Papers are invited from participants at the conference, but also those in the broader academic community active in this field.  
  
The aim of the special issue is to showcase papers illustrating how geomorphometry can be used in hydrology and the potential for future developments in hydrology and earth systems sciences resulting from geomorphometry. The linkage between geomorphometry, the science of quantitative land surface analysis, and hydrology is intimate, since geomorphometry aims to describe land surfaces that are shaped by, and shape, hydrological processes on the earth's surface. Topics of interest to the special issue might include, but are not restricted to:

- Methods for classifying objects within catchment areas (that is to say attaching semantics to catchments to allow their description and comparison).
- Investigations of the potential of new data sources, such as LIDAR, for hydrological parameters, and the development of new parameters to describe catchments at such resolutions.
- Methods to link processes across scales through, for instance, comparisons of catchment properties across scales and comments on their robustness with respect to uncertainty.
- Scalable methods for calculation of hydrological parameters at continental and global scales.
- Linking topographic parameters at a variety of scales to hydrological processes.
- New advances in methods for pre-processing, analysis and visualization of elevation models for hydrological and earth system sciences applications.

When preparing papers for the special issue, it is important that authors make clear the relevance of the work to hydrology and earth systems sciences in the sense of the general aims of [HESS](http://www.hydrology-and-earth-system-sciences.net/index.html).  
  
Submissions must be new, unpublished work which is has neither been previously published, nor is under consideration for publication elsewhere except in the form of an abstract or proceedings type publication.  
  
Submissions will be accepted for review from the 1st of September through [**HESS's online submission system**](http://www.hydrology-and-earth-system-sciences.net/submission/index.html). Please carefully review [all of the information](http://www.hydrology-and-earth-system-sciences.net/submission/index.html) provided by HESS in preparing your submission. Note that HESS is an open-access journal with associated page charges.
