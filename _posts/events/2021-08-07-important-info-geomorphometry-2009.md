Dear Geomorphometry Participants,

Geomorphometry 2009 is getting closer, and this post contains important information with respect to the conference. All of this information, together with **maps** and a **programme** is also in the attached PDF, so as to provide a printable set of information.

# Arrival and Travel in Zurich

Most of you will either arrive by train or plane. If you are staying near the University, then the easiest way to travel from the airport is to take a Tram (10) from outside the airport building. Follow the signs through the terminal and the airport shopping centre to find the tram stop. For all other locations, it is simplest to take a train to Zurich HB (the main station). In both cases you need a 1-way ticket to the city, which you can buy from machines or people at the airport railway station and tram stop. Always travel with a ticket – inspections are frequent, and not speaking German won’t save you from an expensive fine. In town, the cheapest way to get around is with a _Tageskarte_ – a 24 hour ticket valid from the time of purchase for the whole city for the next 24 hours. These cost 8.00 SFr and can be used on trains, buses, trams and even boats inside Zone 10. Note that the airport is not in Zone 10! You can find a **Zurich travel network plan**. Trams are every 10 minutes or so. Weather The weather in Zurich is changeable. So, plan for it hopefully being warm and sunny, but possibly also being rainy and cold! Our conference dinner venue will involve some walking, whatever the weather.

# Conference Registration

**Registration will be open on Monday, 31st August from 8.30**. The attached map shows the route from the Irchel and Milchbuck tram stops to the registration desk, which is adjacent to the lecture theatre where the single conference track will take place.

# Conference Events and Facilities

**There will be a Welcome Apéro on Monday evening** (drinks and snacks) and the conference dinner will be on Tuesday evening. The conference dinner will be traditional Swiss food, with a vegetarian option, in a restaurant in the nearby hills. Travel there will be by public transport, and we will travel there together. During the conference there will be two coffee breaks per day and lunch will be in the University Mensa, using tickets that you will receive on registration. There will be wireless access to the Internet in the University buildings, through accounts which we will provide on arrival.

# Workshops

If you have signed up for a workshop, you will receive detailed information about your workshop separately in August.

# Conference Programme

A provisional conference programme is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/pdf/Geomorphometry_final_ann.pdf). We are delighted to have 3 keynote speakers, as well as an exciting programme of conference talks. Information for Presenters All talks have a slot of 25 minutes, including questions and changeover. Thus, we plan to use a single machine for all talks. This machine will have Internet access, Powerpoint 2003, and Adobe Acrobat installed. If you have other, special requirements, please let us know in advance. We will gather talks before each session at the registration desk for installation and testing. If you have any questions about the conference then please don't hesitate to contact us.

We look forward to meeting you in Zurich.

Best wishes,

_Ross Purves, Stephan Gruber and Ralph Straumann Local organisers_
