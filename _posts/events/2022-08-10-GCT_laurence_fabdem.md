7:00 MDT (UTC -6), 9:00 EDT (UTC -4), 10:00 BRT (UTC - 3), 14:00 BST (UTC +1), 15:00 CEST (UTC +2), 16:00 EEST (UTC +3), 21:00 CST (UTC +8)

**Bio:** Laurence Hawker is a Senior Research Associate at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) specialising in global flood models and Digital Elevation Model data. He develops flood simulations and advances global datasets to support them to understand current and future flood risk. Currently, Laurence works on the EvoFlood project which aims to assess the relative importance of hydro-climatology, evolving channel and floodplain morphology and population dynamics in causing changing flood hazard and risk.

**Abstract:** In this session, Laurence will introduce FABDEM (a new 30m global 'DTM'), provide updates on the latest product developments and show a few examples of using FABDEM in flood applications. We are keen to create a dialogue on user feedback and experiences with FABDEM, be it the good, bad or the ugly, so we can discuss how 'fab' FABDEM really is.
