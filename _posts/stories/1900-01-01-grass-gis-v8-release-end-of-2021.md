The GRASS GIS development team has used the lock-down times also to work hard on the v8 release of the popular GRASS GIS software (see [complete list of new functionality](https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass8Planning)).

There are many new additions to the raster library expected and likely Digital Terrain Modeling and analysis should likely run smoother. The GRASS GIS will stay available via QGIS but also will provide direct Python 3 support and of course R community should be able to access GRASS modules directly via the [rgrass](https://rdrr.io/rforge/rgrass7/) package.

We are looking forward to seeing the new GRASS GIS in action!
