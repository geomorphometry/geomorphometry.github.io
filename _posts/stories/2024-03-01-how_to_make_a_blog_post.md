So you want to post something to geomorphometry.org? Excellent!  

The posts themselves are quite simple to make. Just write it using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and it should work. If you're new to markdown, [this guide](https://docs.github.com/pt/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) can help you with the first steps.

The website is hosted at Github and deployed as a github-page, so not _all_ markdown formatting works. Check [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/) to see what works and what doesn't. 

When including figures, make sure they look good on the web without being too heavy and don't worry about having the image files in a different folder, just keep all the files in the same place, and we'll organize the files here (images are being stored into `/img/posts/some_fig.jpg` but you don't need to use that same path, of course).

Once you're happy with your post, zip everything and send it to us using the [contact form]({{site.baseurl}}/contact). The content will be moderated by ISG board members before being published.
