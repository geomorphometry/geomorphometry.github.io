The creator of the Terrain Analysis System (TAS) has decided to migrate his package to open source. The new version of the software, now called "Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools" is available for download from the [**department homepages**](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/).

Prof. John Lindsay is currently looking for potential graduate students (Masters) to join his research programme at the University of Guelph. Interested individuals are encouraged to [contact](http://www.uoguelph.ca/geography/people/faculty/lindsay.shtml) him.
