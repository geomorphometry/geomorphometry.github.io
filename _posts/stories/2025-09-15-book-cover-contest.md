Dear geomorphometry community,

We are pleased to invite submissions for a cover design contest for the second edition of the [Geomorphometry book](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/geomorphometry/reuter/978-0-443-33376-7), to be published in 2026.  

The submissions will be gathered in a poll, and the entire community will be able to vote for their favorite design.  

If your design is selected, you will receive the appropriate credits, but would need to provide the necessary permissions to use the image.  

You can submit your design by [email](mailto:geomorphometry@gmail.org) before October 17th. Please ensure that the image is of at least 300 dpi resolution.  

 
Get designing!   

 
The editors,  
Hannes Reuter  
Carlos Grohmann  
Vincent Lecours
