#### The International Society for Geomorphometry (ISG) is an international association of researchers and experts open for free exchange of knowledge and opinions about various aspects of DEM processing and digital relief analysis.

### What is geomorphometry?

**Geomorphometry** is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis (also known as the science of Digital Terrain Modelling and Analysis). It draws upon mathematical, statistical, and image-processing techniques to quantify the shape of earth's topography at various spatial scales. The focus of geomorphometry is calculation land-surface parameters and features, which may be used to improve the mapping and modelling of landforms, soils, vegetation, land use, natural hazards, and other information. With today's rapid growth in sources for mass-produced surface heights (digital elevation models, or DEMs), such as the Copernicus DEM and laser ranging (lidar) technology, geomorphometric methods are becoming increasingly attractive to many disciplines. The operational focus of geomorphometry is the extraction of land-surface parameters and objects from digital elevation models (DEMs). In the most simple terms, geomorphometry is everything you can extract from DEMs!
